Problem 30: See kmeans.py

Problem 32: See repflds.png that uses 400 centers.

Bonus Problem: I implemented minibatch kmeans. Therefore, see repflds_batch.png for a 400 center minibatch=200 repflds visualization.

Additional File: real_input.png -> I wanted to see how the scaled image version looks like. It is actually quite hard to distinguish between different objects, especially in gray.
