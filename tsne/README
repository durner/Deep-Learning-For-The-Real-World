This is using the https://github.com/lvdmaaten/bhtsne/ implementation for generating the images. Please first compile the binary for your arch.

Problem 28: Since the normal python implementation of tSNE is quite slow, I also choice to use BHtSNE for this question. I plotted CIFAR and the 20 NewsData. For the NewsData please download and extract those files in the root of the github repository.

Problem 29: I did reproduce the Figure 5 of the paper using the real values as the marker. Therefore, zooming into the picture shows the corresponding y value.
